Markdown cheatsheet at [http://warpedvisions.org/projects/markdown-cheat-sheet.md](http://warpedvisions.org/projects/markdown-cheat-sheet.md).\n2. R markdown reference from R Studio's site at [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)\n3. [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html)\n    + Item 3a\n    + Item 3b\n4. Source 4\n\n## Bulleted (unordered) list\n\nAs previously mentioned, the objectives of this document are two fold.\n\n* Learn the basics of markdown\n* Learn how R code and output can be interspersed with markdown to create reports/documents.\n- Another one\n    + Item 3a\n    + Item 3b\n+ And yet another one\n\n\nHow can headers be defined?\n=============================\n\nThe header used above can be created using a different approach, using a single _hashtag_ (wasn't that in _italics_?) to the left of the title of the header.\n\n# Header 1 \n## Header 2 \n### Header 3 \n#### Header 4 \n##### Header 5 \n\n\n# Images\n\nYou can insert images in the document as well. For instance, if you have an image of a real apple in your working directory, then you can insert it in the document in the following manner.  \n\n![This is a picture of a honey crisp apple](apple.jpg \"A real =apple, a honey-crisp one\")\n\nIf you wanted to show an images from a website, then that can also be done.\n\n# Tables \n\n| Header | Header | Right  |\n| ------ | ------ | -----: |\n|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $10  |\n|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $20  |\n\n* Outer pipes on tables are optional (if you are not concerned with aesthetics, just drop)\n* Colon used for alignment (right versus left)\n\n# HTML Tags\n\nYou can use html tags as well in markdown documents. For example, you could've used an `<img>` tag to insert images. Super basics of html can be [found here](http://bryanhadaway.com/super-basic-html-guide/) \n\n# Equation\n\n\nStandard deviation, $s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}$\n\n\n# Blockquotes\n\nA friend once said:\n\n> It's always better to give\n> than to receive.\n\n# Manual Line Breaks\n\n**End a line with two or more spaces**  \n\nFor    \nexample, this   \nline looks insanely      \nchopped.\n\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\nsuperscript^2^\n\n~~strikethrough~~\n\n# Let's talk about mixing R code with markdown\n\n## Getting to know your dataset\n\nNumber of rows and columns (in that sequence)\n\n```{r}\ndim(iris)\n```\n\nNumber of rows\n\n```{r}\nnrow(iris)\n```\n\nNumber of columns\n\n```{r}\nncol(iris)\n```\n\nNames of variables\n\n```{r}\nnames(iris) # colnames(iris) also gives that information\n```\n\nFirst 6 rows \n\n```{r}\nhead(iris)\n```\n\nFirst 2 rows\n\n```{r}\nhead(iris,2) # alternately, can use iris[1:2,]\n```\n\nLast 6 rows\n\n```{r}\ntail(iris) # Number of rows can be controlled, see earlier example involving the head command\n```\n\nFirst row\n\n```{r}\niris[1,]\n```\n\nFirst row, first column\n\n```{r}\niris[1,1]\n```\n\nName of third column\n\n```{r}\nnames(iris)[3]\n```\n\n3 entries from third column\n\n```{r}\nhead(iris[3],3) # alternately, can use iris[1:3,3]\n```\n\nStructure of the dataframe (dataset)\n\n```{r}\nstr(iris)\n```\n\nSummary of the dataframe\n\n```{r}\nsummary(iris) # for factor/categorical variables, this gives a count of all categories\n```\n\nCreate a dataframe\n\n```{r}\nPerson=c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\")\nAge=c(15,20,25,30,35)\npage=data.frame(Person,Age)\nmean(Age) # gives the mean of the variable Age, prior to the creation of the dataset\nAge=\"\" # (resetting that)\nmean(Age) # Haha\nmean(page$Age)\nmean(page[,2])\nsummary(page)\n```\n\n\n",
